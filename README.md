# Unraveling-Ghibli-s-Magic-A-Data-Inspired-Reflection
This Project is driven by SQL

**Introduction:**
Studio Ghibli films have a way of staying with us it is not just for their breathtaking animation, but for the deeply human (and often non-human) characters that live in their fantastical worlds. Rather than simply watching these stories unfold, I wanted to explore them from a different angle: through data. What if we could analyze the world of Ghibli the way we explore real-world phenomena using SQL?
As someone who often finds artistic inspiration in Ghibli’s dreamy landscapes, I decided to blend that creativity with data analysis. This project transforms the magic of Ghibli into something measurable and insightful turning beloved characters into rows, relationships into joins, and special powers into queryable features.

**Objective:**
To uncover hidden patterns and unique traits of Studio Ghibli characters by analyzing a curated dataset using SQL. The aim was to understand their attributes, relationships, and identities through a data lens revealing details that might be missed by the naked eye but uncovered through structured queries.

**What I Did Using SQL:**
With SQL as my storytelling tool, I analyzed various aspects of Ghibli characters — from demographics and physical traits to powers and connections. I utilized techniques including SELECT statements, aggregation functions (AVG(), COUNT()), joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions (RANK()), conditional logic (CASE WHEN), and array operations like UNNEST() and string_to_array() to surface meaningful insights.

**Key Insights:**
1) Average Age and Gender Distribution: The average character age hovers around 11 years. Male characters account for 55% while female characters make up 44% of this enchanting universe.
2) Top Places of Residence: Characters hailing from Japan, Europe, and Wales tend to be taller than average. In fact, Japan is home to the tallest Ghibli character on record Totoro at 215 cm!
3) Shared Special Powers: Characters like Arren and Ashikata share physical enhancements like strength and agility, while Fanny and Fujimoto both possess powers to shape-shift and control size.
4) Species Distribution: Human characters make up 71% of the dataset, while mystical beings like cats and spirits contribute to the magic and diversity of the Ghibli world.
5) Unique Special Powers: Powers like Totoro’s teleportation, Haku’s dragon transformation, and Howl’s ability to fly and wield magic remain one-of-a-kind in the dataset.
6) Character Height Rankings: Totoro tops the chart at 215 cm, followed by the mighty Okkoto at 200 cm.
7) Characters in Post-2000 Films: Characters introduced after 2000 such as Haku and Howl — often stand taller than average in their respective stories, symbolizing their significant presence.
8) Count of Unique Powers: Characters like Okkoto, Arren, San, Howl, and Princess Kaguya each have three unique powers, adding layers to their complexity and appeal.

**Conclusion:**
Using SQL to explore the Ghibli universe revealed fascinating dimensions to characters we thought we already knew. This project combined storytelling with data to show that even in a world of fantasy, structured information can unlock hidden tales. Studio Ghibli's magic doesn’t just live in its visuals and narratives it lives in the data too. And this is just the beginning of discovering those stories through a data-driven lens.
